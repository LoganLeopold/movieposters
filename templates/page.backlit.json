The 1 inch thick aluminum frame is constructed to 29.5in wide by 42in long, with a seamless finish and a sturdy hinge mechanism for simple poster exchange. The LED lights are both lightweight and low-energy, making wall-hanging easy and upkeep inexpensive.<\/p><p>Light diffusing optical acrylic and another layer of protective acrylic hold the poster in place and provide optimal visual impact. The frame plugs into a standard North American electrical outlet.<\/p>"
